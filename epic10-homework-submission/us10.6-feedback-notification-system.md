# US10.6: Feedback Notification System

## User Story

**As a** student  
**I want to** be notified when feedback is available for my assignments  
**So that** I can review it promptly and apply the suggestions

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System notifies students when feedback is available through multiple channels:
   - Dashboard notifications
   - Email notifications
   - Mobile push notifications (if app is installed)
2. Notifications include:
   - Assignment name
   - Feedback type (AI, teacher, or both)
   - Time when feedback became available
   - Direct link to view feedback
3. Dashboard shows a notification counter for unread feedback
4. Students can mark notifications as read
5. Students can customize notification preferences
6. Email notifications include a summary of the feedback
7. System sends reminders if feedback remains unviewed after 48 hours
8. Notifications are grouped by assignment to prevent overwhelming students
9. Students can see all past notifications in a notification history
10. System tracks notification delivery and open rates
